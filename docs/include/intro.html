            This document provides an intuitive introduction to the NIDASH Data Model for neuroimaging data
            sharing. NIDASH defines a core vocabulary that extends the PROV Data Model for provenance with terms that
            capture information about neuroimaging research, from data acquisition to analysis and results. This primer
            explains the fundamental NIDASH concepts and provides examples of its use. The primer is intended as a
            starting point for neuroimaging scientists or developers interested in using or creating apps with NIDM.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        This section provides an overview of the NIDASH Family of Documents and suggestions to the neuroimaging community
        for implementing these standards to support data sharing activities, as well as in reporting issues or comments.

        <h4>NIDASH Family of Documents</h4>
            <p>
                This document is part of the NIDASH Family of Documents, a set of documents defining various aspects of
                neuroimaging research that are necessary to achieve the vision of inter-operable interchange of information in
                heterogeneous environments such as the Web, research consortia, and laboratories. A list of current <abbr
                title="Neuroimaging Data Sharing">NIDASH</abbr> documents and the latest revision of this specification can be
                found in the <a href="http://nidm.nidash.org/specs"><abbr title="NIDASH Data Model">NIDM </abbr>specification
                index</a>. These documents are listed below.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This primer document provides information on the NIDM-Experiment specification. The goal of NIDM-Experiment is to 
            provide terms that describe entities and activities for general scientific experiments with a focus on those 
            specific to 
            neuroscience. It is meant to work with NIDM-Workflow, which describes the processing and analysis of data and NIDM-Results
            that describes the results of workflows in the fMRI domain. It also provides terms used in PyNIDM, which can be 
            used to annotate data.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview of the NIDM Experiment Component</h2>
        <p>
            This section provides an explanation of NIDM-Experiment, which is based on the  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">
            W3C PROV ontology (Prov-O)</a> that has as it basic elements Entities, Activities, and Agents.  In constructing 
            NIDM-Experiment, we have reused terms from existing terminologies and ontologies where possible. Terms that are 
            reused from other ontologies are imported into the main NIDM-Experiment OWL file and can be found in the /imports  
            directory.  The most extensive 
            modality coverage is for MRI, but there are also terms useful for electrophysiology experiments.  Extensions to 
            other modalities and expansions of existing modalities are ongoing and requests for the inclusion of terms for 
            specific experiments are encouraged.

        </p>
        <p>
           NIDM-Experiment will be integrated into PyNIDM  <a href="https://github.com/incf-nidash/PyNIDM">
            PyNIDM</a>in the future.  PyNIDM will include a mechanism by which users can 
           search for terms necessary to annotate their specific dataset.  It will also provide a mechanism by which 
           users can request needed missing terms to be included in future NIDM-Experiment releases.
